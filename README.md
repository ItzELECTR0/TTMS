### Today The Moon Shines: An open-source Indie Game created by a Solo Developer

</div>

## THE SECOND PROJECT
'Today The Moon Shines' is ELECTRO's project 002
<br>The game is developed under ELECTRIS Game Stuidos and the project is under ELECTRIS

## OFFICIAL PAGES
TTMS on Steam: **TBD**

## RESPONSIBILITY DISCLAIMER

Official support is not available to you. If you use the contents of this repository for anything other than building it yourself or examining the code, you are on your own. For any modifications, you will have to rely on yourself or the community for help. I hope this is an understandable request since this is a paid product offered for free officially. This repository will be maintained until the development of the game is complete. This is both an offering to the community and my cloud backup of the game.

Build it yourself. It's still free, and it's better than piracy.
<br>Buying a copy of the game is showing your support towards the project. And I deeply respect it.
<br>(Don't buy non-official or 'cheap' keys, they are more often than not stolen and/or illegal)

## WHAT IS TTMS?
Today The Moon shines is a small game.
<br> It's purpose is to deal with the burnout caused by **[TWAOS](https://github.com/ItzELECTR0/TWAOS)** by being on much smaller scale

## THE PREMISE
The sun has vanished. The cause is unknown.
<br>The moon shines during the day, nothing lights up the night.
<br>Can you **survive** in a **frozen** wasteland?

## The STORY
### **TBD**

## The GAMEPLAY
### **TBD**

## DEVELOPMENT PLANS

### Story-wise:
The game is planned to have a short story, and maybe some <b>extras</b>.

### Game-wise:
I will first create a functional game. Make all of the story playable, then focus on quality.
<br>When the game is playable, it will come out as an alpha build.
<br>As quality improves in graphics and design, it will move on to beta, and finally a release.
